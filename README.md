# odin-recipes
(a trial project to test my html knowledge until now, i've been learning for 16 days through the odin project)

well, here's my story...
my name is seif (known as geom) and i'm from egypt, i'm learning web development for one reason only, to get married to the love of my life...
i want to get a good paying job to afford to buy a house and get what's necessary for this marriage such as her parents requests like the jewelery and stuff, i'm studying in college currently (english and translation major) in my country it's extremely hard to get a good paying job, so i'm learning web development, i don't need much money, only about 50k USD or less, but in my country, this is almost impossible to get during a lifetime especially now in the current economy...

so, i'll do my best for her, i'm ready to do all it takes to make it happen, because without her, i'll be alone forevor, she's all i have and my only wish from this world...
so, wish me luck.
